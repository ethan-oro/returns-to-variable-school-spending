## Abstract

Currently, most--if not all--of the existing literature estimating the effect of educational investment on a variety of output metrics do so using linear regression with relatively unimpressive explanatory power. From these models researchers tend to find weakly positive causal relationships between increased investment and increased achievement. We seek to improve upon this by using more sophisticated models to model outcomes based on investment and a number of other controls. We find that there are great gains to be made in explanatory power from these new models, but they still support the findings of the existing literature: that the relationships between increased investment in a variety of arenas and many different measures of school success are weakly positive.
